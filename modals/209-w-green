    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>209 W. Green is a complex Queen Anne style house built in 1899, distinguished by its classical details. Asymmetrical details, including shingle patterns, differentiating wall planes, and complex windows, break up the horizontality of the white wood siding. The inclusion of classical details, including the full-length porch, make 209 W. Green typical of the &quot;Free Classic&quot; subtype of the Queen Anne style. The one-story, classical porch is decorated with an ornamental entablature detailed with incised garlands and thin rectangular panels. This entablature is supported by classical columns of the Ionic order. The main entrance is accented with a shingled triangular classical pediment and small windows in the tympanum. Large squat urns flank either side of the entry stairs. The wavy iron balustrade on the porch is unusual for Queen Anne homes, which typically eschewed iron detailing. The main façade includes a simple rectangular bay window. The complex roof line consists of two cross gables, one of which dominates the front façade. The triangular portion of the gable is covered in shingles and houses a small round window. The tapered base of the main gable is detailed with an unusual Palladian-style window that is recessed in a round arch which tapers out at its base. The foundation is constructed of tan brick and has a rounded arch detail beneath the balustrade of the porch. Stick detailing supports the overhanging second level façade on the west side of the building. An oriel window protruding from the east side of the house is supported by brackets. These overhanging features are typical for the Queen Anne style. A rounded protrusion is also found on the first level of the east façade. The east and west façades are dominated by large shingle covered gables with flared corner eaves. An indented bay window sits in the center of the triangular portion of the east gable. The lintels and window sills of the windows have classical detailing including square dentils below them. Many of the windows have decorative stained glass panes.</p>
