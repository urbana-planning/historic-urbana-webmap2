    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>The Lindley house is a fine, intricately detailed Queen Anne-style house. Currently the home of the Lindley House Bed and Breakfast, 312 W. Green Street was designed by Urbana native and University of Illinois Graduate Rudolph Zerses Gill in 1895 for his clients Dr. Austin M. Lindley and his wife Minnie. Dr. Lindley and his wife lived in the house until 1922. The house is a grand scale, measuring two and a half stories, and each time one looks, a different subtle Queen Anne detail is discovered. This style of Queen Anne is sometimes referred to as &quot;gingerbread ornamentation.&quot; The main form of the house consists of pairs of steeply-sloped intersecting gable roofs, a common form of Queen Anne architecture. Some other notable features of the house are the asymmetrical façades, the ornately turned spindle porch, varying window types, the differentiating wall surface and wall surface materials, the complex roof line, and the bright colors.</p>
