    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1101 W. Pennsylvania is the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity Greek house which was built in 1930 in the Georgian Revival architectural style. The house is constructed of red brick and has a symmetrical composition. The overall form of the house is divided into five bays, the central three-story entrance bay, two three-story middle bays adjacent to the entrance bay, and two two-story end bays. The end bays have a hipped roof while the middle and central bays have a steeply pitched gable roof with paired double end chimneys. The main entrance to 1101 W. Pennsylvania is located in the center bay and is articulated by six colossal two-story Corinthian columns supporting a classical cornice and balustrade above. The entry door is paneled and has a fanlight above and side lights on either side. The windows on the first story are tall, multi-paned casement windows with white wood muntins. The windows on the second story are squat, multi-paned double hung windows with paired shutters. The third story windows are intricately decorated dormer windows with rounded arch glazing flanked by classical pilasters. All of the classical details on the house are painted white, which contrast nicely with the red brick. All of these features are characteristic of Georgian Revival houses.</p>
