    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1404 S. Lincoln is a French Chateauesque Greek House that is home to the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority. The house was constructed in 1928. The main wall surface of the house is constructed of half timber detailing with stucco infill. The lower story of the house has multi-colored brick detailing around the foundation, around windows and doors, and at the corners. The house has a steeply pitched hip roof. Many of the windows are multi-paned casement windows which are accented by vertical and horizontal half timber detailing. A large rounded bay window protrudes out from the first story. The main entrance to the house is recessed below a small gable roof porch. Two side lights flank the multi-paned doorway. All of these French Chateauesque details add to the charm of 1404 S. Lincoln.</p>
