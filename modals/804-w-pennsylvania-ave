    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>804 W. Pennsylvania is a Tudor Revival style house that was built in 1925. The house is two stories tall and is built on a stone foundation. The house has red brick walls and half timber detailing, which is the use of false timber structure with tan stucco infill. The main fa√ßade is dominated by a steeply-pitched gable roof which is decorated with half-timber detailing. The vertical half-timber details terminate in decorative wood brackets. Distinguishing characteristics of Tudor Revival houses include a high-pitched gable roof with a complex roof line, an asymmetrical form, and half-timber detailing. The main entry of the house is recessed below a flattened pointed arch, known as a Tudor arch. The entrance arch is comprised of rusticated masonry, called quoins, which provides a nice contrast of texture to the brick walls. The brick walls under the entry arch are laid in an English bond pattern, with alternating rows of headers and stretchers. The brick pattern on the rest of the house is an American bond pattern, with continuous rows of stretchers. The house has several different types of windows including groups of tall, narrow, multi-paned casement windows, two of which are topped with a rounded arch and rounded arch brick lintels, and three types of dormer windows; one of which breaks the roof line and has a flared flat roof. The roof line is very intricate, with a cross gable on the east side and a hipped roof on the west side with a very subtle false thatched roof shape. The roof above the entrance has decorative brackets supporting flared eaves. The garage also has a steeply-sloped gable roof with half-timber detailing. The east side of the house has a massive brick chimney crowned with a decorative chimney pot. There is some small iron detail work near the entrance, including a light fixture, an address plate, and iron bars over a small window.</p>
