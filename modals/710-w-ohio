    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>710 W. Ohio is one of the many original Greek Houses still present on the University of Illinois campus. The house is home to the Delta Zeta sorority and was built in 1928 in the Tudor Revival style. The majority of the building is constructed of red brick. The building is a grand scale and is completely asymmetrical. The house has a complex roof line, which is typical of Tudor Revival houses. The main fa√ßade of the house has two steeply-pitched gable roofs which are tucked into the hip roof of the rest of the house. The gables have a limestone capped parapet. The main entrance to the house is found in a two-story rounded oriel, or tower, topped with a conical roof. The entrance in the rounded tower has an arched opening with a flat top. The entrance vestibule is decorated with a wooden spindle balustrade and half-timber detailing. The foundation of the house is stone and in some areas it looks as though the stone is growing up into the brick. There is no straight horizontal line dividing the stone foundation and the brick walls. Many of the windows on the house are double-hung windows, with six panes in the top sash and one pane in the bottom sash, and stone window sills. Several windows protrude through the roof line and a shed dormer window sits between the parapet gables. The first story protrudes out farther than the stories above, and the protrusion is covered by a sloped roof. At the rear of the house, an exit protrudes from the wall surface and is topped with a flared-eave roof. Overall, the Delta Zeta house has many intricate details which make it a grand scale example of Tudor Revival architecture.</p>
