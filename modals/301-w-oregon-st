    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>301 W. Oregon was built in 1903 and in the Colonial Revival architectural style. The house is one and a half stories with a hipped roof with flared eaves.

    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>According to Mathilda Hill, who lived at 303 W. Oregon for her entire life, 301 W. Oregon was built in 1903 as a &quot;honeymoon cottage&quot; for Frank Somers and his wife Aurora. The house currently located at the rear of the lot, facing Cedar St., was owned by Mr. Somers&#39; father and was the original house on the lot. According to local stories, Mr. Somers&#39; moved the home to the rear of the lot because the sounds of horse hooves early in the morning (for ice delivery) disturbed his sleep.</p>
