    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>111 N. Race was constructed in 1910 and is part of Urbana’s historic downtown. The building has been home to the Courier Café since 1980. Unfortunately, the building was partially destroyed by a fire in 1950 and much of it was rebuilt. The building was also remodeled for the opening of the Courier Café in 1980. The building was historically Italianate, as seen on the side façade where there are tall, thin, segmental arch Italianate windows with brick lintels and limestone sills. The front façade has been substantially altered, but there are remnants of the historic Italianate façade, including the discoloration of the brick above the entry which suggests a classical door surround with a triangular pediment. The interior of the building has beautiful tin-pressed ceiling tiles. Despite its alterations, 111 N. Race is still part of the rich history of Urbana’s downtown.</p>
