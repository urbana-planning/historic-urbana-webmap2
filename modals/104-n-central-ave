    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>104 N. Central was built in 1875 by Eli Halberstadt, a prominent grain miller and Mayor of Urbana from 1867 to 1874. The architectural style of the house draws influences from Italianate, Queen Anne (Eastlake Subtype) and Stick styles. The plan of the house is an asymmetrical, picturesque, cross-wing plan which is typical of the Stick style. The house is topped with two intersecting steeply pitched cross-gable roofs with wide, overhanging eaves with exposed purlins below. The house is one and a half stories with a one story kitchen wing at the rear.</p>
