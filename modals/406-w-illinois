    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>406 W. Illinois is a one story Queen Anne house built around 1925. The house has a typical asymmetrical Queen Anne form, a varying roof line with a steeply pitched hip roof in the center and cross gables on either side of the hip roof. One of the cross gables has a pent roof separating the triangular portion of the gable from the wall surface. The house has white horizontal wood clapboard siding. The corners of the house are accented by vertical wood trim. The house is of the Free Classic subtype of Queen Anne due to its subtle classical details. Many of the windows on the house are small rectangular multi-paned casement windows. The window surrounds and the cornice of the house are classical. A simple white band acts as a classical entablature below the cornice. The main entrance to the house is below a triangular classical pediment which is supported by classical columns. The door is flanked by classical pilasters.</p>
