    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>706 W. Ohio is a Spanish Eclectic house that was constructed in 1928. The house was historically the Phi Mu Sorority house but is currently the Beta Sigma Psi Fraternity house. The house is three stories and is constructed of rough tan and orange brick laid in common bond. The fa√ßade is symmetrical. The roof is a low sloping gable roof with slightly overhanging eaves and exposed rafters. The roof was historically a ceramic tile roof but has been replaced. The house is made up of three sections, the central of which has a taller roof than the two wings. The main entrance is recessed below an arcade made up of three rounded archways. An iron balustrade separates the arches. The windows on the first story are paired rounded arch windows with a limestone sill. The windows have leaded glass and are separated by a small limestone engaged spiral Corinthian column. There is a small decorative glazed tile above each of the paired arched windows. The second story windows are simple rectangular multi-paned casement windows with brick sills. The third story does not have windows but instead has decorative grates. A five foot high brick wall topped with ceramic tile encloses a patio preceding the main entrance.</p>
