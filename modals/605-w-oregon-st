    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>605 W. Oregon is a Dutch Colonial Revival house that was built in 1920. The house is two stories tall, which is actually a very unusual type of Dutch Colonial Revival house, as they are usually one story. The house has a very intricate roof line consisting of a cross gambrel roof with odd dormer windows filling in the gap between the cross gambrels. The cornice lines of the gambrel roof are accented with cream-colored trim. The gambrel roof actually projects farther out than the wall below it. The house is covered in horizontal wood shingles which are painted maroon. A large brick chimney penetrates the gambrel roof on the main fa√ßade of the house. The entry porch is recessed and is supported by simple square classical columns of the Tuscan order. The columns sit on concrete piers and support a simple cream-colored entablature. There are a variety of windows on the house, including double-hung windows, casement windows, and bay windows, some of which have diamond-patterned stained glass present. The window frames are also accented with cream-colored classical window surrounds. The splendid composition and intricacies of the house create a beautiful Dutch Colonial Revival building.</p>
