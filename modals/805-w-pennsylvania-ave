    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>805 W. Pennsylvania is a Tudor Revival house that was built in 1932 and is currently home to the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities (IPRH). The wall surface of the house consists of irregularly coursed smooth cut stone. The overall composition of the house is symmetrical, with the main entrance slightly off center. The main fa√ßade of the house has two steeply sloped gable roofs on either end with a cross gable running perpendicular to them in the center. The gables have flared eaves. The second level below the cross gable is decorated with half-timber detailing. The timber is painted pale blue and has white stucco infill.</p>
	<p> The main entrance to the house sits below a one story gable. The door has a flattened Gothic archway, also known as a Tudor archway, with a label molding above. Many of the windows on the house are groups of rectangular multi-paned casement windows divided by stone mullions. Several small segmental arch windows run along the central bay of the first story. Three dormer windows with hip roofs run along the third story.</p>
