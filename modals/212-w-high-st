The porch foundation is constructed of brick and has a stone cap. The main entrance is very simple and there is a transom window above the door. The house has a low-pitched cross-gable roof with a very simple cornice. The windows on the house are tall, thin, double-hung windows. The windows have simple brick lintels with a large white keystone. The house has a tall, thin, brick exterior chimney.

    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>Salmon C. Briggs occupied this house in the early 70&#39;s and Mrs. August Briggs was still an occupant in the 1920s. Mr. Briggs had been an engineer with the Big Four RR and could justly boast that &quot;he had never been in an accident in his life.&quot; Mrs. Briggs had china painting and other artist supplies for sale at her home and friends recall her fondness for china painting. Also they remembered her peacock when it was alive and afterward it was stuffed and on display; also they recall the ever ready smelling salts that were to be found on the table. Grace Briggs, the daughter, was a teacher who lived here from 1893 to 1900. In 1961 this structure had been converted into apartments.</p>
