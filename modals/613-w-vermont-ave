    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>613 W. Vermont exemplifies the Art Moderne style of architecture, a style contemporary with Art Deco. In contrast to Art Deco, which was commonly used in public buildings (such as the Leal School), Art Moderne was almost exclusively used for domestic architecture. The style became popular after 1930 when industrial designers developed the streamlined aesthetic for ships, airplanes, and automobiles. Streamlining combined a sensitivity to austerity brought on by the economic climate of the Great Depression with a future-oriented concern with scientific efficiency. Unnecessary ornament was discarded, drastically reducing the costs of design. Fluid lines, suggesting efficiency, dominated building form. Common features of Art Moderne include smooth surfaces, curved corners, emphasis of the horizontal with grooving and balustrades, flat roofs, asymmetrical facades, glass-block windows, round windows, and windows turning corners.</p>
