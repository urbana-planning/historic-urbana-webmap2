    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>115 W. Main is a Classical Revival building built in 1871 and located in downtown Urbana. The building, known as Tiernanâ€™s Block or the Masonic Temple, is a local historic </p>


    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>The 100 block of West Main is one of the first commercial blocks in Urbana. Originally most of he structures were wood frame, until, the Busey family constructed a new brick building for their bank in 1870. Busey&#39;s Hall was the first brick block constructed in downtown Urbana. These large buildings were known as blocks at this time and were named after the person who funded the construction. The use of brick as a construction material quickly increased in downtown Urbana after a fire in 1871 destroyed most of the downtown area. This fire was compared to the Chicago fire of the same year for the amount of devastation to the community. Busey&#39;s Block survived this great fire because of its brick construction, and from then on brick has been used as the main construction material in the downtown area. Frank Tiernan followed this trend when he built his block in 1871, after the fire. It was a three-story structure, with his grocery store on the first floor, lawyer and dentist&#39;s offices on the second floor, and a large hall space on the third floor. Tiernan&#39;s Hall, on the third floor was a popular opera house, as was Busey&#39;s Hall across the street.</p>
