    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>The Erlanger House was designed by Jack Baker in 1964 for his client Margaret Erlanger, a University of Illinois dance instructor. The house was designed to fit Ms. Erlanger&#39;s needs as a dance instructor. The plan was open to allow for performances during social gatherings. The exterior of the Erlanger House is rather irregular for the neighborhood but it manages to blend nicely into the area. The home was designed in the International Style. Key stylistic features included in the Erlanger House include a simple, unadorned façade; no decorative detailing at the cornice, and around doors and windows; a restrained material palate using only brick, steel, glass, and wood; rectilinear geometry; a flat roof; and windows made up of large panes of glass with metal casements that are flush with the wall surface. The façade of the Erlanger House is bare and simple, with no extraneous decoration or ornamentation. The building is built of a buff Chicago common brick. The house is symmetrical and the front façade has a large brick cube in the center flanked on either side by floor-to-ceiling slits of glass. The entrance is not obvious, as it is not placed on the center axis.</p>


    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>The Erlanger residence, at 303. W. Indiana, was the first of a number of homes in Champaign-Urbana designed UIUC Architecture professor Jack Sherman Baker. Baker, who was born in Champaign in 1920, designed this house for noted UIUC dance professor Margaret Erlanger. Located in the Von Doran section of Carle Park, the house is notable for being designed for privacy and low maintenance. The narrow profile of the townhouse was designed to preserve privacy within a neighborhood with large adjacent homes. As with the Garvey House, the Erlanger House was a node in the Champaign-Urbana avant-garde scene during the mid-1960s. Sal Martirano, the long time resident of Garvey House, was a close associate of Erlanger. Famous choreographer Merce Cunningham, and his long time partner, avant-garde composer John Cage, frequently stayed at the house. Cunningham was the first dancer-in-residence at UIUC and returned frequently to campus.</p>
