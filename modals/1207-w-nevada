    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1207 W. Nevada is the Delta Gamma Sorority Greek house that was built in 1937 in the Colonial Revival architectural style. The house is constructed of brick which is painted white. The house has a symmetrical composition. The form of the house has five bays, a central entrance bay, two middle bays flanking the central bay, and two end bays. The middle and central bays have a steeply pitched gable roof with paired double end chimneys. The two end bays have a hipped roof. The central bay of 1207 W. Nevada is articulated by a two story porch overhang which is supported by tall classical columns of the Doric order. The overhang has a flat roof and the edge is accented by a balustrade. The main entrance consists of a paneled door which sits below a simple classical cornice which is supported by classical pilasters. Side lights are nestled between the pilasters. This type of Colonial Revival entry portal is uncommon to the style. The windows on the first and second stories are squat, multi-paned double hung windows with white wooden muntins and paired shutters. More elaborate multi-paned doors flanked by multi-paned windows are found on the end bays. The windows on the third floor are simple dormer windows with hip roofs. The dormer windows also have multi-paned double hung windows. A string course marks the transition between the first level and the second level. Overall, 1207 W. Nevada is a beautiful Colonial Revival house whose striking white façade stands prominently on the University of Illinois’ campus.</p>
