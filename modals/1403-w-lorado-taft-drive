    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>The Mumford House, currently located at 1403 Lorado Taft Drive, is the oldest structure on the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign’s campus. The house was constructed in 1870 in the Italianate style. The house was designed as a model farmhouse for the University’s experimental farm. The design was based on a design from a pattern book written by Alexander Jackson Downing. The Mumford House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is named for former Dean of Agriculture Herbert W. Mumford. The Mumford house has many simple Italianate features. The house is two stories tall and the overall form of the house consists of two low-pitched cross gable roofs. A simple classical cornice frames the gable roofs, which have wide, overhanging eaves. The house is clad in horizontal wood clapboard siding which is painted white. The main entrance to the house is below a one-story porch which is supported by simple square classical columns. The house also has a lower one story wing projecting from the main form of the house. The house has a brick foundation. A bay window projects out from the main façade of the house. The window above the bay window is a double arched window. The other windows on the house are rectangular double-hung windows with simple classical surrounds. As the oldest structure on the University of Illinois’s campus, Mumford house is unquestionably one of the most important buildings in the city of Urbana.</p>
