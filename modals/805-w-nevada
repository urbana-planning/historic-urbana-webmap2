    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>805 W. Nevada is an Arts and Crafts style house with Shingle Style influences built in 1919. The main form of the house is rectangular with a gable roof that runs perpendicular to the entry. There is a dormer window with a gable roof in the center of the main facade which acts like a cross gable. The façade of the house is asymmetrical. The upper portion of the house is covered in plain coursed, or simple horizontal patterned, brown wood shingles. The lower portion of the house is covered in rough textured brown stucco. The main entrance to the house is reminiscent of a Palladian window, with the tall door in the center and two shorter side lights/windows on either side of the door, which is a characteristic of the Shingle style. A small overhang supported by brackets covers the entry. Most of the windows are casement windows with diamond patterned plate glass. A bay window can be found flanking the main entrance. The west side of the house has a cantilevered wall portion that projects out past the wall surface below. The skillfull combination of the Arts and Crafts style with the Shingle style creates a beautiful house.</p>
