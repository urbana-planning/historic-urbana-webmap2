    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>202 S. Broadway is a Classical Revival building designed by Oscar Wendroth in 1914. The building is home to the Urbana Post Office which is located in Urbanaâ€™s historic downtown. The civic importance of the post office is reflected in its monumental architecture. The building is two stories and is constructed of buff colored brick with a limestone base. The overall composition of the building is symmetrical. The windows on the post office are multi-paned double hung windows with limestone sills. The most distinguishing feature of the building is the main entrance, which is located below a two-story recessed porch which has colossal limestone classical columns of the Corinthian order supporting a classical entablature and cornice. A flat roof with limestone coping rises above the slightly projecting classical cornice. A classical limestone surround accents the main door. A large set of stairs leading up to the main entrance is a grand gesture which asserts the civic importance of the building.</p>
