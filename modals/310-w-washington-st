    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>310 W. Washington is a quaint house built in 1906 in a vernacular style of architecture. The houseâ€™s style can be referred to as American Folk. The house was constructed of wood and this type of construction was highly influenced by railroads springing up around the country. Due to the implementation of railroads, building materials were no longer limited to what was available locally.</p>


    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>The Pittman family has figured prominently in the history of 310 W. Washington. Save for 1951, when Clara Jones owned the property, the Pittman family owned the house from 1906 until 1957, when Robert F. Jones and his wife Leda became its owners. Frank, a carpenter and Margaret Pittman were the first residents. In 1924, Frank Pittman Sr. died and the deed passed to his son, Frank Pittman Jr. and his wife Lydia. In 1940, their son Chas bought the house. Chas was the Chief of the Urbana Fire Department. He later received the title of the Urbana Fire Marshall. The biggest fire he ever helped put out was the burning of the Flatiron building in which $400,000 worth of damage was done. Chas died at the age of 63, leaving the residence to his wife, Louise and their children Raymond and Margaret.</p>
