    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>This by-the-book Tudor Revival style house was built circa 1920. The base of the house is constructed of square, diagonal, horizontal, and zigzag patterned brick. The upper stories of the house are constructed of a dark brown half-timber woodwork pattern with cream-colored stucco infill. The majority of the windows are grouped in horizontal bands of multi-paned casement windows and are surrounded by wood trim. A common feature of Tudor Revival houses is the second story overhanging the first story, which can be seen on 1105 S. Douglas. The main form of the house is a long, steeply-pitched gable roof with two intersecting steeply-pitched cross gable roofs that dominate the main façade. There are two large brick chimneys that protrude out from the roof. Another common feature of Tudor Revival houses are bay windows, one of which can be seen on the southeast corner of the house. The entry is on the central axis of the house. The front door has a flattened Gothic archway, also known as a Tudor arch, and a diamond patterned wood door. The north side of the house has a small gable roof with flared eaves. All of these details are characteristic of Tudor Revival style houses.</p>

In March of 1909, Morris conveyed a large tract property to C.L. Van Doren in trust for the creation of Carle Park.

In addition, 6 blocks surrounding the park were parceled out and added to the city.</p>
