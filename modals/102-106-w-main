    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>102-106 W. Main was constructed around 1880 in the Italianate style and are located along Urbana’s historic Main Street. The buildings are currently three similar yet distinct buildings. Each building is two stories tall and has a large Italianate cornice with classical detailing and large, ornamental brackets. Each façade is constructed of brick, all of which are different colors; the middle building is red brick, the east building is orange brick, and the west building is painted tan brick. Each façade has long, thin, rectangular windows with limestone rounded arched Italianate hoods. The storefronts of each building are very different. The similarities, yet slight variety, of 102-106 W. Main add character to Urbana’s historic Main Street.</p>
