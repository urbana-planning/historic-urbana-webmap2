    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>110 S. Glover is a prefabricated Lustron House. The design and manufacture was the product of an affordable housing design charette suggested by President Truman after World War II to address housing shortage impact returning soldiers. Many architects tried designing prefabricated housing that could be manufactured in mass quantities and assembled quickly. The mass-produced Lustron Home was designed by Carl Strandlund, a businessman and inventor, and became a very successful and innovative solution to the post-World War II housing crisis. The typical Lustron House was a simple house with a form similar to a ranch house, with a rectangular plan and a low-pitched gable roof. The roof and walls of Lustron houses were made of prefabricated steel panels coated with colored porcelain enamel. Lustron houses were manufactured with four factory-colored enamel finish choices including Desert Tan, Dove Gray, Maize Yellow, and Surf Blue. 110 S. Glover was covered in a Desert Tan porcelain enamel. Lustron houses sat on a concrete slab foundation and had large casement windows installed between the square steel wall panels. 110 S. Glover was erected in 1943 and is the only house of its kind in the area. Over 2,680 Lustron houses were erected in the United States after the war thanks to Carl Strandlund’s simple and quickly constructible design.</p>
