    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>Designed by Joseph Royer in 1898 and built in 1901, the Champaign County Courthouse is a Richardsonian Romanesque building that stands prominently in Urbana’s downtown. The courthouse was constructed of solid masonry, a very expensive building technique at the time. However, the solid masonry construction gives the building an air of stability and strength, a symbol representing governmental status typical of municipal buildings of the time. The four-story courthouse, built at as an enormous structure compared to its surrounding context, still towers over the buildings around it. The building is symmetrical and is made up of a five-part façade. The massive square clock tower occupies the center of the building and two bays, identical on either side, flank the tower. The tower is ornate and has a steeply sloped hipped roof. Small dormer windows protrude from the sloped roof. The four corners of the tower are round columns which support decorative fleur-de-lis sculptures. A row of three rounded arches sit below the cornice of the tower. Small balconies protrude out from below the row of rounded arches. The balconies are supported by ornate brackets. Groups of two tall, slender rounded-arch windows are found below the clock. The main entrance can be found at the base of the tower. The main entrance to the courthouse is on the center axis and is deeply recessed under a large, wide, rounded, or Romanesque, arch. The west entrance is also on the center axis and is recessed below a rounded arch.</p>


    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>The architectural style of Richardsonian Romanesque was named after innovative Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and perhaps best represented by his masterpiece, Trinity Church (1887). Richardson used elements from Romanesque architecture while drawing elements from several other styles of architecture. This style was popular for public buildings built in the late 1800s. The Champaign County Courthouse is the only example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture in the area.</p>
