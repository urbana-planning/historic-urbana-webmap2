    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>One former resident, Robert Floyd, owner of Floyd Electric Motor Service spent several summers in the 1950&#39;s prospecting for Uranium in the American west. In various articles in the Urbana-Champaign Courier his efforts were described as akin to fishing trips, except for uranium. His trips were made using a jeep and some basic geological information obtained from the University. While his efforts ultimately proved to be unproductive he stated that he &quot;would like to go prospecting 52 weeks a year.&quot;</p>
