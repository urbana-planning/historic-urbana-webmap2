    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1202 W. Nevada is a French Eclectic Greek House built in 1926. The house was designed by the architectural firm of Clare-Alban W. Coen Company of Berwyn, Illinois. The house is home to the Alpha Delta Pi Sorority and is two and a half stories tall. The house is constructed of orange brick and has limestone detailing, including a belt course below the second story, quoins at the corners, and the window sills. The overall composition of the house is asymmetrical. The house has a very complex roof shape, with a jerkin head roof on one side and a steeply pitched gable roof on the other with a taller hipped roof in the center. The roof is covered with slate roof tiles which tie the complex roof shape together. The house has many small details which add to the character of this French Eclectic sorority house. There are several copper details on the house, including the main entrance roof and the base of a bay window on the second story. Many of the windows are casement windows. Several of the windows protrude through the cornice line of the roof. The outdoor patio spaces are well designed and landscaped. The house has undergone several alterations but the overall structural and historic integrity remain.</p>
