    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1110 N. Nevada is a Colonial Revival house that was constructed in 1929. The house is currently home to the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority. The house has a symmetrical composition and is constructed of red brick. The house is three stories and has many Georgian influences. The house has a simple white wood cornice and a steeply pitched hip roof. The main entrance is recessed below a classical entablature which is supported by classical columns and pilasters. The door itself is a six-paneled wooden door with side lights and a transom which have lacy patterns of zinc cames. A Palladian window motif sits on the second floor above the main entrance. The motif has a rounded arch fan above a simple double-hung window which is flanked by Tuscan pilasters and wooden louvers on either side. The motif has a rounded arch limestone backdrop. A limestone belt course divides the first and second stories. The windows on the first story are tall multi-paned French doors with limestone lintels. The windows on the second and third stories are squat double-hung windows with paired shutters. All of the windows have white wood trim, a characteristic of red brick Georgian architecture. Two one story sun rooms protrude on either side of the main entrance. The sun rooms are constructed of white wood. The front façade of the sun rooms have three pairs of French doors which are separated by classical pilasters of the Corinthian order. Two additions were added to the house in 1951 and 1983 but did not disturb the historic integrity of the main façade.</p>
