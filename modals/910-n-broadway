    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>910 North Broadway Avenue is a Queen Anne house built in 1901. Unlike the majority of Queen Anne homes in Urbana, which are made of wood, 910 North Broadway was built with brick. The house is two-and-a-half stories tall, with steeply pitched, cross-gable roofs, and a one story wrap-around porch with a two story center portion that is supported by brick piers. The rest of the porch has wooden supports and balustrades, and the base of the porch is detailed with brick.</p>
    <p>The triangular portions of the gable roofs are covered with wood shingles and are separated by pent roofs. A Palladian window motif is found in one of the gable triangles. The cornices below the pent roofs are articulated with a differentiating brick pattern. The house features four large, single-pane casement windows with rectangular stained-glass transoms above. The casement windows, as well as several double-hung windows on the house, have segmental arch brick hoods, which is unusual in a Queen Anne house, as such hoods are usually an Italianate motif.</p>
    <p>In 1989, the current owners (as of 2019) purchased the home from their family members, who had purchased it in 1949 from the family of the mason who built the home, James P. Kerr. Next door, at 908 North Broadway, there once sat a home built by Kerr’s parents, where James later resided with his brother, also a mason.</p>
    <p>In 2019, the owners replaced the porch’s ironwork, which had been a later addition, with wooden turned columns and balustrades that more closely resemble the original porch supports. The owners plan to replace the decorative arches on the balcony with more period-appropriate work.</p>
