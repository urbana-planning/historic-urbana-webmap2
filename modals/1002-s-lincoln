    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1002 S. Lincoln is one of the University of Illinois’ many historic Greek Houses. The house is known as the Nabor House fraternity and was constructed as a combination of Colonial Revival and Georgian Revival architectural styles. The house is constructed of brick which is painted white. The upper story is clad in horizontal wood clapboard, which is also painted white. The main façade of the house is symmetrical. A semi-circular staircase leads up to the main entrance, which consists of an elaborate broken ogee pediment above the six paneled door. The pediment is supported by two classical pilasters which are surrounded by glass block windows, a staple of Georgian architecture. A rounded overhang above the porch mirrors the rounded stairs leading up to the entrance. The overall form of the house is intricate and has an interesting roof line. The front façade is flat and the edge is accented by a balustrade. The rear of the house has a gable roof which has shed roofs stacked atop the gable. The majority of the windows on the house are horizontal rows of double-hung windows, some with black wooden paired shutters. The cornice of 1002 S. Lincoln is simple.</p>
