    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1117 W. Oregon is a one story Spanish Eclectic building that was built in 1920 with some Mission style influences. The walls of the building are clad with rough textured tan stucco. The building has an asymmetrical composition and the stucco ties the wall surfaces together. Many of the door and window openings are rounded arches. An arcaded entry porch dominates the north façade. The roof of the building is a low-pitched hipped roof with eaves that do not overhang the wall surface. The west façade has a mission style roof parapet, which is capped with a strip of brown coping. Many of the windows  on the second story are double-hung windows with brown trim. Iron balustrades decorate several of the windows on the second story. These features are all characteristic of Spanish Eclectic architecture. The northwest corner of the first story has bands of storefront glazing.</p>
