    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>510 W. High is a unique, whimsical Arts and Crafts house built in 1910. The façade is constructed of pale yellow stucco with a horizontal brown wood siding base. Other details of the house, including the windows and the roof, also have brown wood trim detailing. The most notable feature of the house is the roof, which is a low-pitched faux thatched hip roof, reminiscent of the thatched roofs of England, with an eyebrow roof line. This roof type gives the house a whimsical feel. The wavy roof line also produces playful shadows. The main portion of the house is two stories and has a rectangular footprint. The east side of the house has a large protruding bay with a steeply-sloped roof and a large hipped roof dormer window. The side bay has a large recessed arched window. Most of the windows are organized in horizontal bands and are multi-paned casement windows. The set of windows on the first story of the front façade protrude slightly from the wall. The main entrance to the house is flanked by two rectangular windows and is covered by a wavy overhang supported by brackets. This playful Arts and Crafts house could have fallen straight out of a cartoon. Influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, this house emphasizes the importance of hand-crafted architecture with its intricate, whimsical details.</p>
