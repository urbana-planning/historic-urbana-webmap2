    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>505 W. Main, known is the Griggs House, is a simple Italianate style house that was built in 1874. The house is two stories and is constructed of brick. The overall form of the house consists of a square base topped with a low-pitched gable roof with an ornate cornice. Intricate wood brackets supported the wide overhanging eaves of the ornate cream colored cornice. The front façade of the house is symmetrical and has a full-width single-story front porch with square wood decorative columns with beveled corners topped with a delicate carved wooden capital and an ornate wood balustrade. An upside down fleur de lie is carved into the cornice of the porch. The windows are tall, narrow, segmental-arched double-hung windows that are divided into four panes. The window sashes consist of two panes each. The windows are &quot;hooded&quot; with a brick segmental arch crown. One of the windows on the main first story of the main façade is replaced with the entry door, which is also topped with a segmental arched hood. Some other small details of the house include a small round window on the west façade, the gable roof line at the rear of the house is lowered to accommodate only one story, and all of the intricate wood detailing is painted a cream color. The Griggs house is a simple, yet elegant, example of an Italianate style house.</p>
