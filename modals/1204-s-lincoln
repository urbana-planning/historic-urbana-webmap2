    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1204 S. Lincoln is a Tudor Revival Greek House that was built in 1924 and is home to the Kappa Delta Sorority. The house is constructed of red brick and has half timber decoration, which is painted red, with white stucco infill on the second story. Small details of the house including arch keystones, window sills, the cornice line, the string course below the second story, and quoins around the doors are stone. 1204 S. Lincoln has a complex roof line with a steeply sloped gable roof on one side and a hipped roof on the other. A large gable extends from the third story almost to the ground on one side of the house. This large gable has two stepped dormer windows above it. The house has massive chimneys topped with decorative chimney pots. The rest of the windows on the house are multi-paned casement windows. Some of the windows protrude through the cornice line of the roof, a common characteristic of Tudor Revival architecture. A one-story arcade of recessed archways and arched windows wraps around the ground floor of the house. The large scale and brick facades of the house make 1204 S. Lincoln a unique Greek House on the University of Illinois campus.</p>
