    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>715 W. Michigan is a Tudor Revival house that was built in 1915. It is home to the Alpha Xi Delta Sorority. The house is one and a half stories, the first story is constructed of brick and the second story is covered with white stucco infill and vertical half-timber detailing, a striking feature of the house. The overall composition of the house is symmetrical and is divided into three bays. The outer bays have a one story bay window of the first level. The second level projects farther out than the first level above the bay windows. These projections are common to the Tudor Revival style. The corner bays have steeply sloped gables, which have slate roofs and widely overhanging eaves. Stick bargeboards sit below the eaves of the gables. Three gable roof dormer windows perch between the corner gables. Rows of multi-paned casement windows with wood trim articulate the vertical half timbering. There are two large brick chimneys on either end of the house. The main entrance to the house is below a Tudor arch with multi-pane double doors. 715 W. Michigan is a typical Tudor Revival residence which was repurposed for a sorority house.</p>
