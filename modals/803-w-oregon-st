    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>803 W. Oregon is a Tudor Revival house that was built in 1907 and is home to the Alpha Sigma Alpha Sorority. The wall surface of the house is constructed of smooth white stucco and brown horizontal wood siding. The overall composition of the house is symmetrical, with the entrance in the center below a porch. The porch is supported by large piers faced with stucco. The house has two small steeply pitched gable roofs dominating the main fa√ßade. A dormer window sits between the two small gables. A large cross gable roof runs perpendicular to the small front gables. The house has several intricate stick detailing, as seen in the flattened pointed archway, or Tudor archway, of the main entrance. There is also a latticework bargeboard on the two main gables. Two bay windows protrude out from the first story. A row of casement windows dominates the bay windows. The second story wall surface above the bay windows projects farther out than the first story wall surface. This is a common Tudor Revival characteristic. Intricate yellow and brown ornaments run along the stucco wall surface in the bay windows and on the entry piers.</p>
