    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>The Lincoln Lodge Motel is a Tudor Revival building that was built in 1952 and designed by Joseph Royer. The main building is a small building constructed of brick. The building has a steeply-pitched gable roof with a large brick chimney projecting from the roof. A long row of shed dormer windows also protrudes from the steeply pitched roof. The triangular portions of the gable roof have half timber detailing with white stucco infill, a distinguishing characteristic of Tudor Revival architecture.  There is a simple wood bargeboard under the eaves of the gable roofs. Simple wooden brackets can be found near the base of the gable roof. Square casement windows with diagonal-patterned stained glass and detailed brick window sills are aligned in horizontal rows. Some windows have wooden planters at the sills. The triangular portion of the gable above the main entrance to the Lodge on the east side protrudes farther out than the first story below it, a common feature of Tudor Revival buildings. Some historic iron pieces still are present on the building, including a lamp near the main entrance.</p>


    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>When the Lincoln Lodge opened in 1952, it was considered one of the finest of its kind. The original motel included 32 rooms built in the English rustic lodge-style, a coffee shop, lounge, and restaurant. Each room was built to accomodate five people. The rooms were air conditioned and centrally heated. A unique feature was the each room had a private dial telephone, part of a project of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company. The interior and exterior were constructed of artificially aged Florida and Louisiana cypress. In late November 1954, the motel was extensively damaged in a massive fire.</p>
