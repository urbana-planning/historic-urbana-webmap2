    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>1106 S. Lincoln is home to the Alpha Gamma Delta Sorority. The house was constructed in 1929 in the French Chateauesque architectural style. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a local landmark. The four story house was constructed at a grand scale. The overall form of the house has an asymmetrical composition and an L-shaped plan with a round tower in the crook of the L. The house has a complex roof line with several intersecting hip roofs. The house is constructed of buff colored brick. The house has a variety of window types, including many multi-paned casement windows with wood trim, rounded arch windows with stone quoin detailing, and segmental arch windows. Some of the windows have paired shutters and some of the windows actually protrude through the cornice line, a common detail of French Chateauesque architecture. There is some half-timber decoration with stucco infill below the cornice of the round tower and on the rear of the house. The main entrance to the house is recessed below a Tudor arch which is set into a small gable projection. The second story wall surface on the southwest corner of the house protrudes farther forward than the first story wall surface below it, another common detail of French Chateauesque architecture. There is a massive chimney topped with decorative chimney pots on the exterior of the house. Overall, 1106 S. Lincoln is a very beautiful intricately designed French Chateauesque house worthy of its place on the National Register and as a prominent Greek House on the University of Illinois campus.</p>
